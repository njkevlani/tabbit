# Tabbit
A tab based, webapp layout for reddit with minimal vim-like navigation keybindings.
## TODO
- [x] Vim keybindings to navigate

- [ ] Better Card Layout for posts

- [ ] Config for data usage on media: (Do not load media | Load media at low quality | Load media at highest quality possible)
- [ ] Add info: Upvotes, Awards
- [ ] Direct post URL
- [ ] Infinite loading (currently only loads first 25 posts)
- [ ] Configurable subreddit list (use local storage for storing srList)
- [ ] Code quality Overall
- [ ] Better way to inplement hjkl navigation. With methos: init() which will regiseter hjkl keys; registerHL(arr) which will register arr element navigation on HL keys; registerJK(arr))
- [ ] Minimize dependencies
